Writing, especially fiction writing, is an iterative process. This article was revised <strong>TK</strong> times before publishing. Writers, however, tend not to show their creative process—the final product usually stands on its own, free from markups, strikethroughs or track changes. Gregory Mazurek, a computer programmer from New York, has used the tools from his day job to show that the process can be just as important as the final product.
Mazurek, whose pen name is <a href="https://twitter.com/gregorygershwin" target="_blank">Gregory Gershwin</a>, is a software engineer at the online retail site Gilt. Like many programmers, Mazurek uses GitHub, a version management and file hosting website to keep track of his work. GitHub allows multiple users to make changes to the same file, but it saves a version of the file every time a change is made. This means if a mistake is found, or the programmers decide to go in a different direction with their project, they can revert to any previous version of a file whenever they want.	
Mazurek, who has been writing fiction in his spare time since college, told Quartz that he usually uses Google Docs to write, but realized that formatting a book for ePub—the text format used on many e-book readers—he needed to use something more technical. "Creating the ePUB was the impetus for moving everything to GitHub," Mazurek told Quartz.
Once his book, <em>Benjamin Buckingham And The Nightmare’s Nightmare,</em> was finished, Mazurek publicly shared the GitHub project so anyone could see the changes he made to the story along the way. Mazurek said that he originally hadn't intended to make the project public, that he had just used GitHub as a way of keeping track of his thoughts and making sure he could access his work from multiple computers. But after he showed the project to his friends, they convinced him that there was artistic value in sharing the changes made along the way, as well as the novel itself.

The revisions are <a href="https://github.com/gregorygershwin/Benjamin-Buckingham-And-The-Nightmares-Nightmare-Novel" target="_blank">online</a> for anyone to access, and they show just how much can change before the final product is released. Mazurek compares his GitHub repository to a time-lapse video of "a painter in a studio painting a canvas over a time." The book's original first chapter was <a href="https://github.com/gregorygershwin/Benjamin-Buckingham-And-The-Nightmares-Nightmare-Novel/commit/5d5de86d9a1de95d05fcb6d70d6298b2c275f3dd" target="_blank">deleted</a>, an evil character was changed to a <a href="https://github.com/gregorygershwin/Benjamin-Buckingham-And-The-Nightmares-Nightmare-Novel/commit/41638c0f54d0ea525c00fc39b7186bed0d17d97a" target="_blank">good one</a>, and the main character went from being "<a href="https://github.com/gregorygershwin/Benjamin-Buckingham-And-The-Nightmares-Nightmare-Novel/commit/dde63f138773a3f5e7c67280479f7e7568eca578" target="_blank">whiny</a>" to resolute. Mazurek's notes and random thoughts are dotted throughout the repository. "It goes in and out of states of readability," Mazurek said. "It has comments that are nonsensical. It’s sometimes brutally honest and sometimes terribly unsure of itself."

While there are many tools for public collaboration on the web—Google Docs itself allows multiple users to edit work and track old versions—GitHub <a href="https://github.com/features" target="_blank">says</a> it's the largest collaboration repository for code on the web. By using GitHub, Mazurek's edits can be downloaded by any enterprising programmer and turned into something interactive. "I’d love to see an app that could allow you to hover over portions of text while reading the story to uncover what that text was in an earlier version," Mazurek said. There's some analog precent for this, too—<a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Waste-Land-Transcript-Annotations/dp/0156948702" target="_blank">T.S. Eliot</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/On-Road-The-Original-Scroll/dp/067006355X" target="_blank">Jack Kerouac</a> and <a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/ulysses-james-joyce/1100390353?ean=9780374280338" target="_blank">James Joyce</a> have all had draft versions of their work published.	
Mazurek said he put his work on GitHub because it's easy to use, and to show to a new generation of writers that there are tools available to make the creative process "totally fun in different ways." While the future of books is, for now, <a href="http://qz.com/326801/the-future-of-books-looks-a-lot-like-the-past/" target="_blank">just more of the same</a>, Mazurek shows how the creative process behind published work is changing in a digital world. "For just about everything I wrote prior to this novel, I started on paper," Mazurek said. He's already working on a follow-up novel, which he says he is also uploading to GitHub, but like with his first GitHub project, he's keeping it private until he's finished.	
"There are mistakes, there are revisions, there are errors, more revisions," Mazurek said about writing. "It’s sometimes pretty, often revealing. It’s just my creative process to eventually get at the end result."
